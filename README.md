# Brain tumor segmentation on magnetic resonance imaging
This project aims to assess automatically each of the regions within a type of brain tumor called Glioma.

To tackle this problem, we have a dataset got from the BraTS challenge organized by MICCAI society. The dataset is composed of MRI images of around 370 patients. Four sequences (T1, T1Gd, T2, FLAIR) were taken for each patient, where the main difference between them is the type of tissue that is stood out. In addition, the dataset provides a ground truth labeled by hand by neuroradiologists, which corresponds to the manual segmentation. Due to label the four sequences by hand is a tough task and takes a long time, we propose an artificial intelligence architecture to deal with the problem automatically.

Five different architectures have been tested. 3D U-Net, V-Net, and Residual U-Net were used as a baseline since minor modifications were done. Then again, Shallow and Deep U-Net are our proposals. One of the modifications carried on, comparing our proposals to the original 3D U-Net, is the replacement of the Batch Normalizations layers by Instance Normalizations layers (to ensure that the normalization was done individually for each sequence). Moreover, the activation layers ReLU were replaced by Leaky ReLU. Finally, Shallow/Deep U-Net uses four/seven levels of depth and four/seven skip connections instead of the 3 levels and skips implemented in the 3D U-Net.
